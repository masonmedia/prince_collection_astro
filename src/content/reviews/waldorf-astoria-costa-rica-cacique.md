## Waldorf Astoria Costa Rica Cacique Opening in November 2024

Hilton has plans to open the Waldorf Astoria Costa Rica Cacique property in November 2024, with the new property taking up residence on the Pacific coastline of the Guanacaste province, a short 40-minute drive to the Daniel Oduber Quirós International Airport in Liberia.

The new hotel will be in good company, as this part of Costa Rica is already home to other luxury properties, such as Four Seasons Peninsula Papagayo, JW Marriott Guanacaste Resort & Spa, and Andaz Costa Rica Resort at Peninsula Papagayo.

Located on a dramatic cliffside peninsula and overlooking the secluded Playa Penca, the hotel stands to be a luxurious and relaxing retreat for guests while still providing easy access to many nearby activities.

The hotel will have 188 guest rooms alongside lavish private residences, and guests will be able to enjoy a variety of amenities including a multi-level pool, on-site restaurants, a spa, a fitness centre, and more.

The hotel’s use of wood and light-coloured stone elements imbues the indoor spaces with a warm and contemporary aesthetic,aesthetic which is a pleasant complement to the lushlush, rainforest surroundings.

Additionally, the layout of the hotel has been designed to fit naturally within the landscape’s terrain as it angles towards the ocean, and wildlife corridors have been incorporated to ensure the safety of the local fauna.

This newest Waldorf Astoria property has been in development for over 10 years, so the excitement and anticipation has certainly had time to grow. With any luck, an official opening date will be announced shortly, and travellers can begin to plan their stays.

The Four Seasons Hotel Seattle is ideally situated for business, leisure, or a combination of the two.

You can’t get any closer to the city’s famed Pike Place Market, where you can sample artisanal goods and catch glimpses of fish being tossed between mongers at seafood shops. If you’re in search of some arts and culture, across the street is the Seattle Art Museum, and a few steps further afield is Benaroya Hall, both located in the heart of the Central Business District. Down a staircase from the hotel is the city’s waterfront, complete with restaurants, attractions, and trails that offer the perfect spot for a morning walk, run, or ride. If you're headed anywhere close, take advantage of the Four Seasons Seattle's complimentary house Tesla car service, which will take you to downtown shops and sights in style. To make your way to or from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in around 20 minutes, opt for the hotel’s private airport transfers in a luxury sedan, or easily make your own arrangements via taxi or rideshare.

Nestled in the heart of the city, the rooms at the Four Seasons Seattle capture the essence of Seattle's innovative spirit and balance this with unrivaled comfort. As you step into the room, the king bed, clad in immaculate white linens with the Four Seasons logo subtly stitched onto each pillow, promises a night of decadent slumber. To start the day, you could enjoy a Nespresso using the provided machine, but we recommend you treat yourself and not miss out on the coffee concierge service, available from 6am to 10:30am. After a quick call down to the front desk, hotel staff will bring you a fresh cup of coffee without you even having to get out of bed.

The room’s earthy tones are enhanced by the subtle Northwest-inspired décor and warm lighting. Bathed in natural light filtering through gauzy curtains, a cozy nook with a plush chaise longue provides space for quiet thought or peaceful repose. The room is also equipped with modern amenities. The sleek flat-screen TV, positioned perfectly for viewing, sits directly across from the king bed and rests atop a sound bar for an enhanced experience. Nearby, a table for two awaits, perfect for an in-room dining experience – a popular choice among guests – making meals a functional and enjoyable affair. The floor-to-ceiling windows offer moody views of Elliott Bay, showing off the dynamic energy of Seattle and the peaceful waterfront promenade.

In the bathroom, the expansive vanity, with its polished marble countertop, offers ample space, and the large marble soaking bathtub invites you to unwind. The glass-enclosed rain shower, mimicking the famous Seattle rain, provides a rejuvenating experience with every drop. You can also keep an eye out for the model Boeing aircraft in your room, which pays homage to the city's aviation history.
