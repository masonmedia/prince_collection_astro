Perched atop a hill that overlooks the gorgeous Elliott Bay is the **Four Seasons Hotel Seattle**. If you're in search of a luxurious stay in the heart of the city, or are in need of a blissful escape from the region's notoriously moody weather, you've come to the right place.

# Four Seasons Hotel Seattle -- Location

The Four Seasons Hotel Seattle is ideally situated for business, leisure, or a combination of the two. You can't get any closer to the city's famed Pike Place Market, where you can sample artisanal goods and catch glimpses of fish being tossed between mongers at seafood shops.

If you're in search of some arts and culture, across the street is the Seattle Art Museum, and a few steps further afield is Benaroya Hall, both located in the heart of the Central Business District.

Down a staircase from the hotel is the city's waterfront, complete with restaurants, attractions, and trails that offer the perfect spot for a morning walk, run, or ride.

If you're headed anywhere close, take advantage of the Four Seasons Hotel Seattle's complimentary house Tesla car service, which will take you to downtown shops and sights in style.

Navigating yourself to the rest of the city is easy from the nearby University Street Light Rail Station, which provides convenient access to the city's many sporting venues, the Space Needle, and the Museum of Pop Culture.

Opt for the hotel's private airport transfers in a luxury sedan, or make your own arrangements to arrive at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in around 20 minutes.

## Four Seasons Hotel Seattle -- Rooms

Nestled in the heart of the city, the rooms at the Four Seasons Seattle capture the essence of Seattle's innovative spirit balanced with unrivaled comfort.

As you step into the room, the king bed, clad in immaculate white linens with the Four Seasons logo subtly stitched onto each pillow, promises a night of luxurious slumber.

To start the day, you could treat yourself to a Nespresso, but don't miss out on the coffee concierge service, available from 6--10:30am. A quick call leads to hotel staff bringing you a fresh cup of coffee without you having to get out of bed, which makes for a perfect start to the day.

Subtle Northwest-inspired décor and warm lighting enhances the room's earthy tones, with natural wood and leather textures.

Bathed in natural light filtering through gauzy curtains, a cozy nook with a plush chaise longue provides space for quiet thought or peaceful repose.

The room is also equipped with modern amenities. The sleek flat-screen TV, positioned perfectly for viewing, sits directly across from the king bed, and rests atop a sound bar for an enhanced experience.

Nearby, a table for two awaits, perfect for an in-room dining experience -- a popular choice among guests, making meals a functional and enjoyable affair.

The floor-to-ceiling windows offer moody views of Elliott Bay, showing off the dynamic energy of Seattle and the peaceful waterfront promenade.

In the bathroom, the expansive vanity, with its polished marble countertop, offers ample space, and the large soaking bathtub invites you to unwind in a marble embrace. The glass-enclosed rain shower, mimicking the famous Seattle rain, provides a rejuvenating experience with every drop.

Keep an eye out for the model Boeing aircraft in your room, which pays homage to the city's aviation history.

## Four Seasons Hotel Seattle -- Dining

Goldfinch Tavern, the hotel's sole dining establishment, connects seamlessly with the hotel's lobby.

Open all week with dedicated hours for breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and dinner, it's rare to find the space without a buzz.

For the best experience, opt for a table by the expansive glass windows to enjoy views of Elliott Bay, or retreat to a private booth for a more intimate affair.

The seasonal menu highlights local goods with a seafood-forward focus, celebrating the region's bounty.

Indulge in the Aphrodite oysters paired with some bubbles for a special toast, or warm up from the inside with a delicious bowl of chowder.

Be sure to catch the daily happy hour at Goldfinch Tavern, which is a popular affair among locals and guests alike.
