Hilton recently announced that it has acquired a majority controlling interest in Sydell Group, with plans to expand its NoMad hotel brand.

NoMad hotels is a luxury lifestyle brand with an emphasis on food and beverage, interior design, and service.

The acquisition and associated partnership between Hilton and Sydell Group signals an exciting step in Hilton’s ongoing expansion of their luxury hotel offerings.

# Hilton Acquires NoMad Hotels

Hilton has acquired a majority controlling interest in Sydell Group, the parent company of the NoMad hotel brand. 

The deal involves Hilton taking over all development of NoMad hotels, while Sydell will retain design, branding, and management.

Under the NoMad brand, Hilton plans to develop upwards of 100 properties in the most desirable neighbourhoods worldwide, creating spaces that are both “grand and intimate” while also being “classic and playful.”

These characteristics are well in line with the aesthetics of the two current NoMad properties located in London and in Las Vegas.

Hilton will take control of the London location as part of the acquisition, while the NoMad Hotel Las Vegas, which is affiliated with Marriott Bonvoy partner MGM Resorts, will be rebranded.

The flagship NoMad Hotel London is a haven of chic elegance situated in a beautiful 19th-century building in the historic Covent Gardens neighborhood.

The property, which will be available to book within Hilton’s portfolio later this year, is an excellent representation of what guests can expect from the brand going forward.

NoMad fits beautifully into Hilton’s portfolio of luxury brands, which already includes Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts, LXR Hotels & Resorts, and Signia by Hilton. 

As a luxury brand, NoMad will likely be welcomed as part of the Hilton Impresario preferred partner program, allowing guests to enjoy exclusive perks and benefits when booking through a registered travel advisor like Prince Collection.

The details on this have not yet been announced, but we expect to see this confirmed in the coming months.

Of interest, this recent acquisition is further building on Hilton’s efforts to grow its high-end portfolio, coming only a couple months after the hotel brand announced a new exclusive partnership with Small Luxury Hotels of the World.

## Conclusion

Hilton continues to expand its luxury hotel offerings with the acquisition of a majority stake in Sydell Group. 

Beginning later this year, guests will be able to book the NoMad London through Hilton, and over the coming years, they will be able to enjoy lavish stays at many new and exciting NoMad properties.  

As a luxury brand, NoMad hotels will likely be a part of the Hilton Impresario preferred partner program. By booking through the preferred partner program, you’ll enjoy a suite of extra benefits for your stay at no additional cost, including complimentary breakfast, a $100 (USD) property credit, a potential room upgrade (subject to availability), and more.
